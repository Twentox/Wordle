# Worlde with Javascript, Hmtl & Css

### Explanation: 
---
When you visit the Wordle website, you're greeted by 5-wide by 6-long grid of empty, white boxes. Each box can hold one letter, and so you guess at the answer by typing in a five-letter word and pressing 'Enter'.

There aren't any clues up front, so any five-letter word will do as an initial guess. That's where the game of Wordle really starts. When you send a guess along, the color of each letter's box changes.

- If it turns green, that letter is in the daily word and you've placed it in the right spot.

- If it turns yellow, the letter is in the word but you have it in the wrong position.

- If the box turns red, it means the letter isn't in the word at all
